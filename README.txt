The following files are present in the folder:
1. all_globals.py -> defines all the global parameters such as dataset name, model name etc. which are used for interpretability calculation. The use of each Individual field is defined in the file itself.

2. finalWithLogEntropy.py -> base file which is to be run.





Instructions for running:
1. Modify the global parameters as per the experiment in all_globals.py

2. Set no_samples_all as the list of no. of samples used for training of both models A and B. Based on the dataset, calculate the number of samples corresponding to 10-100% of the dataset and put the list of samples here.

2. Run python finalWithLogEntropy.py.
